Dear Hiring,Technical Manager,
Thanks for this great opportunity. 
In this Assignment, I have used React Js as a Frontend and Express Js as a Backend with MongoDB as a database.
In this project, I have created two rest full API 
1. Auth API
2. Client API
The First API is responsible for login the admin into the main page with the help of JWT and Passport etc.
The Second API is responsible for getting the clients and adding the client to our database.
These two APIs are interlinked for authentication purposes. 
In order to make the responsive front end, I have used Bootstrap 5, Material UI etc. 
I have also used the context API for login and logout purposes.
I have also uploaded the snapshot of the UI part.
Thanks and Regards
